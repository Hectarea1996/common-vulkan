# Common Vulkan Guide

Welcome! This guide is based on the official [Vulkna Tutorial]. However, this guide will not teach Vulkan like the tutorial does. This guide will show you
how the code you see in the Vulkan Tutorial should be using Common Lisp. I'm sure that most of the users that come here have already done at least once
the tutorial, that's why this will be just a guide. 

I tried to generate functions that are as close as possible as the original ones. But Common Lisp is a different languaje and it means that some functions
need to be slightly modified. If you don't know how a function works in the Common Lisp side you can find it in the 
[Api Reference](https://hectarea1996.github.io/common-vulkan/api/).

I think I'm not missing anything so..., let's code!
