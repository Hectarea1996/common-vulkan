# Common Vulkan Reference

Welcome the Common Vulkan Api Reference! 

## What is this?

This reference will not teach you what the Vulkan functions do. Here you will see how the functions are in Common Lisp and the types of the arguments and returned values. Like the Vulkan Guide, this is complementary material. Your main source of information should be the official Vulkan Specifications. 

## How this works?

Given a function or structure from vulkan, search it in this reference. You will see then the Common Lisp side of these names.
