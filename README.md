# common-vulkan

Common Lisp bindings for the vulkan library. 

**WARNING**: This library is still in development. My first objective is to be able to complete the official vulkan tutorial with these bindings. I'll be adding code and documentation in my free time. I want to make my own game engine made completely with Common Lisp, so I think that this project will be active for a long time.

# Documentation

The [documentation](https://hectarea1996.github.io/common-vulkan/) contains an API reference and a Vulkan guide.

# Dependencies

It only depends on the [more-cffi](https://github.com/Hectarea1996/more-cffi) library. Clone it to your `quicklisp/local-projects/` folder.

# Installation

You need the vulkan SDK installed in your computer. You can get it on its [main page](https://vulkan.lunarg.com). 

Afterwards, clone the [more-cffi](https://github.com/Hectarea1996/more-cffi) library into your `quicklisp/local-projects/` folder. Finally, clone this repository into your `quicklisp/local-projects/` folder.
