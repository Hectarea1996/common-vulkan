# common-vulkan

Bindings for the common vulkan library. 

**WARNING**: This library is still in development. My first objective is to be able to complete the official vulkan tutorial with these bindings. I'll be adding code and documentation in my free time.

# Documentation

The [API reference](https://hectarea1996.github.io/common-vulkan/index.html) shows you how the functions are in this library and how to use them.

# Dependencies

It only depends on the [more-cffi](https://github.com/Hectarea1996/more-cffi) library. Clone it to your `quicklisp/local-projects/` folder.

# Installation

You need the vulkan SDK installed in your computer. You can get it on its [main page](https://vulkan.lunarg.com). 

Afterwards, clone the [more-cffi](https://github.com/Hectarea1996/more-cffi) library into your `quicklisp/local-projects/` folder. Finally, clone this repository into your `quicklisp/local-projects/` folder.
